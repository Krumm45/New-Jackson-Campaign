            <h1 style="font-size: 35px; color: white; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Andrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, on the border of North and South Carolina. He was the son of irish immigrants and received little formal schooling. When the British invaded the Carolinas in 1780-1781, both his mother and his two brothers died during the conflict. And during this conflict, he was taken as a prisioner by the British. When Jackson refused to shine one officer's boots, the officer struck him across the face with a saber, leaving lasting scars. He eventually moved west of the Appalachians to the region that would soon become the state of Tennessee, and began working as a prosecuting attorney in the settlement that became Nashville. It is during his career that he would learn about the law and eventually move to more govermental jobs.  </h1>
